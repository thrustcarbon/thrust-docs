## Why integrate with Thrust Carbon

Integrating as a Travel Marangement Company (TMC), enables you to:

* Own sub-accounts for each client, with their data cleanly separated.
* Automatically add client travel data to a client's sub account.
* Earn revenue from reselling client sub-accounts.
* Accurately calculate a client's carbon emissions, and generate beautiful reporting.

## Integrating with Thrust Carbon

### Overview

At a minimum, your API integration will need to do the following:

1. Make authenticated calls to the Thrust Carbon API.
2. Setup sub-accounts for each client.
3. Add client data to their sub-account.

### 1. First steps & authentication

Before integrating, we recommend:

* Visiting your Thrust Carbon account (https://app.thrustcarbon.com).
* Setting up a user account for each developer. You can do this by navigating to the 'Account' menu, and selecting 'Organisation Settings'.
* Discover your API credentials. You can do this by navigating to the 'API' menu, and selecting 'Credentials'.
* Read the [Authentication Guide](../guides/2.Authentication.md).

### 2. Setup sub-accounts for each client

Before setting up a sub account for a client, we recommend reading the [Partner Guide](../guides/3.Partner-Guide.md).

Once you are confident with how partner accounts work, you should:

* Send a request to add a new sub-organisation for each client. [Click here to read more about this API request](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/3-organisation-settings.v1.yaml/paths/api~11~1setting~1organisation~1sub-organisations/post).
* Save the returned `id` in your database, as this refers to your client within our system.
* Add the `organisation_id` parameter, containing the above id, to future requests when you add each client's data. 

### 3. Add client data to their sub-account

Data sits under a project in the Thrust Calculator:

* We recommend creating one project for each client, which will hold all of that client's data.
* [Click here to read more about the API request for adding a project](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/1-calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects/post) (don't forget to include the client's `organisation_id`).

Once a project is setup you need to add their data:

* You can add each travel segment individually. [Click here to read more about adding a single segment to a project](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/1-calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects~1%7BprojectId%7D~1segments/post).
* You can add up to 100 travel segments as a batch job. [Click here to read more about adding a batch of segments to a project](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/1-calculator.v1.json/paths/~1projects~1%7BprojectId%7D~1segments~1batch/post).
