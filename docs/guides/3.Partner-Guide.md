# Partner Guide


<!-- theme: warning -->

> ### Partner accounts are restricted
> Please contact your account manager for access.

Partner accounts give you the ability to create and manage other Thrust Carbon organisations. Further more, organisations can be nested within sub-organisations to create sub-sub-organisations.

An organisation has access to the data of all its descendant organisations, and is responsible for any billing charges incurred by those descendants.

## Which APIs to use?

As a partner, you will want to use our [Organisation Settings APIs](endpoints/5-organisation-settings.v1.yaml) in order to manage accounts of your clients (see below).

Want to calculate emissions? We have two different ways of calculating emissions use Thrust Carbon:

1. **Thrust Calculator** is a persistent datalake, where you may store emitting items (called segments), and then generate reporting for those items. The Thrust Calculator has both free and paid accounts.
    1. Free accounts can manage their data through the API, however they CANNOT access emissions data for their segments, most statistics, or in-depth reporting.
    2. Paid accounts can manage their data through the API, and emissions data for each segment, as well as all statistics and reporting.
2. **Emissions API** will calculate emissions and return a result. The calculation will not be saved on the Thrust Carbon system for later reporting or statistics. Emissions API requests are charged for each calculation.

We recommend using the Emissions API if you wish to calculate the emissions of ALL your clients, both paid and unpaid.

## Using the partner API

### Use endpoints as another organisation

To act as another organisation, take the organisation's ID and pass it into your request under the `organisation_id` key. 

*Note: to keep the documentation simple for non-partner users, we have not included examples using 'organisation_id' outside of this page. However please note that all Thrust Carbon API endpoints accept the organisation_id key, allowing you to act as those organisations.*

### Create new organisations

* You can create new organisations:
  * Using your Thrust Carbon account settings panel
  * [Using the API](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/3-organisation-settings.v1.yaml/paths/~1api~11~1setting~1organisation~1sub-organisations/post).

### Creating further embeded organisations
If you wish to create a organisation below another organisation (e.g. a sub sub organisation), then you just need to pass in the `organisation_id` of the new organisation's parent (see the 'Use endpoints as another organisation' documentation above).

For example: lets suppose you have the following organisations:
````
Parent organisation (ID: ABC)
-> Sub organisation (ID: EFG)
````

You would create a new organisation under the sub-organisation by passing in an `organisation_id` equalling `EFG`, to create the following hierarchy:

````
Parent organisation (ID: ABC)
-> Sub organisation (ID: EFG)
-> -> Sub sub organisation (ID: IJK)
````
