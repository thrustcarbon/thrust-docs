# Partner Guide


<!-- theme: warning -->

> ### Partner accounts are restricted
> Please contact your account manager for access.

Partner accounts give you the ability to create and manage other Thrust Carbon organisations. Further more, organisations can be nested within sub-organisations to create sub-sub-organisations.

An organisation has access to the data of all its descendant organisations, and is responsible for any billing charges incurred by those descendants.

## Use endpoints as another organisation

To act as another organisation, take the organisation's ID and pass it into your request under the `organisation_id` key. 

*Note: to keep the documentation simple for non-partner users, we have not included examples using 'organisation_id' outside of this page. However please note that all Thrust Carbon API endpoints accept the organisation_id key, allowing you to act as those organisations.*


## Create new organisations

* You can create new organisations:
  * Using your Thrust Carbon account settings panel
  * [Using the API](https://docs.thrustcarbon.com/docs/thrust-docs/endpoints/3-organisation-settings.v1.yaml/paths/~1api~11~1setting~1organisation~1sub-organisations/post).

### Creating further embeded organisations
If you wish to create a organisation below another organisation (e.g. a sub sub organisation), then you just need to pass in the `organisation_id` of the new organisation's parent (see the 'Use endpoints as another organisation' documentation above).

For example: lets suppose you have the following organisations:
````
Parent organisation (ID: ABC)
-> Sub organisation (ID: EFG)
````

You would create a new organisation under the sub-organisation by passing in an `organisation_id` equalling `EFG`, to create the following hierarchy:

````
Parent organisation (ID: ABC)
-> Sub organisation (ID: EFG)
-> -> Sub sub organisation (ID: IJK)
````
