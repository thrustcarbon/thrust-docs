        #### Description of department endpoints

        **Department endpoints let you set additional details for each department key**. These additional details are use in other Thrust Carbon products, such as correct department names on Thrust Calculator reports or in the Thrust Engage dashboard. 

        For example, a department with key '123' may have the name 'US HR' attached, and a description of 'Human Resources department for United States'. Since the department id of '123' is not understandable to most users, the name can be used instead.
