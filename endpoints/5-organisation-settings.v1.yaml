        This list endpoint will provide a paginated list of all groupings in your organisation.

        ---
        #### Creation of groupings

        While you can forcefully create a grouping using the POST endpoint, groupings are typically created through segment requests. When creating a segment you may associate the segment with one or more groupings, and these will be automatically created for you.

        ---
        #### Description of grouping endpoints

        **Grouping endpoints let you set additional details for each grouping key**. These additional details are use in other Thrust Carbon products, such as correct department names on Thrust Calculator reports or in the Thrust Engage dashboard. 

        For example, a grouping with key '123' may have the name 'US HR' attached, and a description of 'Human Resources department for United States'. Since the grouping id of '123' is not understandable to most users, the name can be used instead.

        --- 
        #### Online interface

        You may create/read/update/delete groupings manually via your account settings at https://app.thrustcarbon.com

        #### Considerations

        * Please add data in chronological order (e.g. inputting parents before child groupings). A child grouping cannot be saved against a parent_id if that parent does not exist.
        * Please make requests to this endpoint sequentially, not concurrently. You otherwise risk inserting an item before its parent is fully loaded.
        * Please use the batch endpoint if you wish to add many groupings. You may otherwise hit our rate-limiter.

        Adds a new grouping type to an organisation.

        ### Slug
        When you create a grouping type, the ‘slug’ is the key you will be using in future requests. You can enter your own slug identifier that will be used in future requests, or you can use the one we generate and return. A slug is only valid if it is lowercase letters, numbers and dashes.

        If there is already a slug within the organisation, a random number will be appended to the organisation.

        Example slugs:

        * The name 'Cost centre' will have the slug `cost-centre`
        * The name 'Default' will already exist, so the slug will become `default2`

                    Optional. We recommend you **do not** provide a slug, as Thrust Carbon will attempt to generate a unique valid slug for you. 

                    A slug must only have lowercase letters, numbers and hypens. 

                    If your slug is not valid, we will attempt to transform it into a valid slug before checking that it does not already exist.

        **Please note:** 

        * No groupings can be associated with a grouping type that you want to remove. If you attempt to remove a grouping type with groupings you will receive a 422 response.
        * The `default` slug grouping type cannot be removed. If you do not want to use this, you should update the grouping type so that `is_reportable` is false.
