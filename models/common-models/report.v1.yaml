  A report can be generated via the Thrust Calculator. If you have white-labeling setup on your account, this report will be shown in your company's own branding.

  At present, you can create reports for:
  * **Impact** - displaying charts and graphs of the calculation's CO2 impact.
  * **Offset Options** - displaying a list of potential offset options that can be purchased to offset the calculation's CO2 impact.
  * **Offset Certificates** - a PDF containing all certificates for the offsets purchased.

  > ### Report validity
  >
  > Your reports are static documents that will become invalid as soon as the calculation they are based upon is updated. We indicate validity with the `is_valid` field. How you wish to deal with invalid reports is up to you.
  >
  > *Note: you can still download an invalid report until it reaches its expiry date. This enables you to download reports for calculations that you are updating constantly.*

  <!-- theme: info -->

  > ### Reports are no longer accessible after their expiry date
  >
  > By default, all Thrust Carbon reports will expire after 7 days, after which time the report cannot be downloaded.
  > 
  > The report may become invalid before this time

  <!-- theme: info -->

  > ### Reports are generated asynchronously
  >
  > Our reports take 10 to 60 seconds to generate. You should subscribe to Thrust Carbon webhooks to ensure your system is updated when the status of a report changes.
