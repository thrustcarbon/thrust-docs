  A `Grouping Type` is a type that any grouping can be associated with. Grouping types must be setup in advance, but once they are setup you can associate as many groupings as you wish.

  Examples of grouping types:

  * Cost centre.
  * Department
  * Purpose code

  Every organisation has a default grouping type called `default`. This cannot be removed, however you can rename it.
