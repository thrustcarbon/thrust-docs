  Car segment request. 

  Notes for requesting a car segment:

  * You must provide either a `distance` or number of `days` that the car is in use (e.g. for a car rental). When you provide `days`, we will estimate the distance travelled.
  * The car type can either be a SMMT market segment code, or a 4 letter ACRISS code (i.e. a car rental agency code; e.g. CDAR for a Compact car).
  * You should only provide the location of the car at the start of the journey. This can either be a 3 letter IATA code (e.g. _NYC_), or a 2 letter country code (e.g. _US_)
