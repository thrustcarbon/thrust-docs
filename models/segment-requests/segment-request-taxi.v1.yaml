  In order to provide a taxi segment, please provide either:

  * A distance travelled.
  * Spend based data (in which case we will attempt to calculate distance based on spend).

  Helpful information:

  * You should provide a country code of the taxi journey in the locations array.
  * If the journey is in London, please set `taxi_type` to `LONDON_TAXI`
