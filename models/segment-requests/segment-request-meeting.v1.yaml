  You can accurately calculate the carbon emissions of your meeting using this segment request. Please provide as much detail as possible:

  * `type` must equal _meeting_.
  * `locations`. This should be an array containing the 2 letter country code of the meeting.
  * `size` of the room in square meters.
  * `hours` of the meeting.
  * `attendee_count` for the number of meeting attendees.
  * `laptop_count` indicating the number of laptops you expect to be in use at the meeting.
  * `hot_beverages` and `cold_beverages` indicating whether beverages will be served. 
  * `meal_count` indicating the number of meal portions that will be served (e.g. breakfast and lunch for 10 people will be a meal count of 20).
