  Hotel segment request.

  *Note: for hotel emissions you should only send one location in the locations array.*

  Notes:

  * The provided location should be a 2-letter country code.
  * Hotel calculation methodologies are limited in the market-place, however we expect them to substantially improve over the next 24 months. You should therefore try and provide as many details as possible (e.g. rating codes and chain codes), in order to future proof your integration.
