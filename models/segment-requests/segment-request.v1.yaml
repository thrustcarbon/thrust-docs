  * This is the model for creating or updating a segment, *if you are getting an already created segment from the API, please the [Segment](../segments/segment.v1.yaml) documentation*
  * Every segment request extends the [same base](./segment-request-base.v1.yaml), we recommend reading the documentation for the segment type you are trying to create:
      * [Air segment](./segment-request-air.v1.yaml)
      * [Hotel segment](./segment-request-hotel.v1.yaml)
      * [Rail segment](./segment-request-rail.v1.yaml)
      * [Car segment](./segment-request-car.v1.yaml)
      * [Coach segment](./segment-request-coach.v1.yaml)
      * [Ferry segment](./segment-request-ferry.v1.yaml)
      * [Vacation rental segment](./segment-request-vacation-rental.v1.yaml)
      * [Taxi segment](./segment-request-taxi.v1.yaml)
      
  *Note: we are constantly adding more segment request types all the time, and our documentation may lag this. Please reach out to your account manager if you believe a segment type is missing.*
